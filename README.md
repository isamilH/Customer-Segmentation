# Customer-Segmentation
The project in your notebook is focused on Customer Segmentation using the K-Means algorithm, which is a centroid-based clustering technique. The goal is to group customers based on their transaction behavior to gain insights for marketing or business strategy purposes.
Project Breakdown:
* Steps Involved:
  1. Data Loading: The dataset used for customer transactions is being imported and processed.
  2. Data Preprocessing: Techniques such as scaling and PCA (Principal Component Analysis) might be used to standardize and reduce the dimensionality of the data.
  3. Clustering: The K-Means algorithm is applied to the preprocessed data, and methods like the Elbow method and Silhouette Score are used to find the optimal number of clusters.
  4. Evaluation: Metrics such as Silhouette Score, Calinski-Harabasz Score, and Davies-Bouldin Score are calculated to evaluate the clustering performance.
