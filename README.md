# Customer-Segmentation
The project in your notebook is focused on Customer Segmentation using the K-Means algorithm, which is a centroid-based clustering technique. The goal is to group customers based on their transaction behavior to gain insights for marketing or business strategy purposes.
Project Breakdown:

    Introduction to K-Means Clustering:
        K-Means is used to divide the customers into distinct segments (clusters). The number of clusters kk is a hyperparameter chosen by the user.

    Steps Involved:
        Data Loading: The dataset used for customer transactions is being imported and processed.
        Data Preprocessing: Techniques such as scaling and PCA (Principal Component Analysis) might be used to standardize and reduce the dimensionality of the data.
        Clustering: The K-Means algorithm is applied to the preprocessed data, and methods like the Elbow method and Silhouette Score are used to find the optimal number of clusters.
        Evaluation: Metrics such as Silhouette Score, Calinski-Harabasz Score, and Davies-Bouldin Score are calculated to evaluate the clustering performance.

    Visualization:
        The project includes the use of libraries like seaborn, matplotlib, and plotly for visualizing customer segments, possibly with PCA-reduced dimensions for easier interpretation.
